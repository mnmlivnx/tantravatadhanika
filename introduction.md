# Introduction

Abhinavagupta was the great Kashmiri polymath of the tenth century who wrote
*Tantrāloka* (“Light on the Tantras”), a work of encyclopaedic nature and an
excellent source of the Tantric Śaiva literature, philosophy, and practices.
Abhinavagupta, who wrote extensive commentaries on the tantras as well as
the exegetical literature by the various systems that flourished in Kashmir
between the sixth and the tenth centuries, greatly influenced the development of
Indian philosophy, religion, and culture up to the present day. His contribution
is, however, still relatively unknown despite the efforts of some brilliant
scholars who have done much to remedy this situation in the last decades.
Although the interests in Abhinavagupta, who contributed to the fields of
philosophy, aesthetics, literary theory, dramaturgy, musicology etc., extends
beyond the confines of these disciplines, he is little known to other fields of
study. The main reason for this is that many of his works still remain untranslated.

Abhinavagupta wrote three condensed works of his magnum opus *Tantrāloka*,
to present the non-dual Śaiva doctrines and practices in a more accessible and
digestible form. Indeed, it is not hard to see why Abhinavagupta felt the need
for this, due to the lengthy and complex nature of the *Tantrāloka* (along with
Jayaratha’s commentary it consists of about 12 volumes in more than 3500 pages).
These abbreviated works are the *Tantrasāra*, consisting of twenty-two *āhnika*-s
(chapters) written in prose, *Tantroccaya*, comprises of ten *āhnika*-s also
written in prose, and lastly, the briefest digest out of three;
the *Tantravaṭadhānikā*, consisting of three *āhnika*-s, written in ninety-eight
verses. Out of these texts, the *Tantrasāra*, the lengthiest exposition of
the three, is comparatively well-known and studied, whereas the *Tantroccaya*
and the *Tantravaṭadhānikā* are much less known.

The practice of writing shorter and simplified abstracts of longer works
containing elaborate and difficult philosophical arguments that required years
of training in Sanskrit grammar and logic was s a common practice by the old
pandits. This made it possible for people without sufficient training but with
a keen interest to still dive into the teachings. The adherence to this
tradition is also clearly seen in Abhinavagupta’s most prolific disciple,
Kṣemarāja. Even if, as noted above, the brevity of the works can sometimes
present more difficulty for the modern reader, they would have been less
difficult to understand a millennium ago, when the doctrines and practices were
alive and widespread.

As in the *Tantrāloka*, the first *āhnika* of the *Tantravaṭadhānikā* introduces
the general matters; the nature of bondage and liberation and the role of
knowledge concerning the attainment of the latter. Here Abhinavagupta also
alludes to the doctrine of impurity (*mala*) and the descent of power
(*śaktipāta*). Most verses found are devoted to explaining the nature of
consciousness as autonomous selfluminosity. Abhinavagupta introduces the variety
of means to liberation (*upāyas*) and the thirty-six principles (*tattva*-s) of
the knowable reality, both of which he will elaborate on in the following
two *āhnika*-s. The second *āhnika*, which is the shortest of the work, deals
with the four *upāyas*; “the non-means” (*anupāya*), “the divine-means”
(*śaṃbhavopāya*), “the empowered-means” (*śāktopāya*), and “the individual means”
(*āṇavopāya*). The content of this chapter corresponds to *āhnika*-s 2, 3, 4 and
5 in the *Tantrāloka* (and *Tantrasāra* and *Tantroccaya*) where Abhinavagupta
devotes one chapter to each *upāya*. This chapter ends with a brief description
of the relationship between the disciple and the guru, that is found towards
the end of *āhnika* 20 in the *Tantrasāra* and *āhnika* 15 in the *Tantrāloka*.
The third *āhnika* begins with an exposition of the “path of time and space”
(*deśakālādhvan*), that appears in *āhnika*-s 6-8 in *Tantrāloka* and 6-7 in
the *Tantrasāra*. This chapter also gives the account of the hierarchy of
*tattva*-s, which is treated in the ninth and tenth chapters of the *Tantrāloka*
and chapters 8-10 in the *Tantrasāra*. The second half of this chapter is
devoted to the descent of power (*śaktipāta*) and a summary of various kinds of
initiation (*dīkṣa*); “initiation into the rules/tradition” (*samayadīkṣa*) and
“initiation as a spiritual child” (*putrakadīkṣa*), all of which concern
*āhnika*-s 11-19 and *āhnika*. 22 in the *Tantrasāra* and *āhnika*-s 13-27 and
*āhnika* 29 in the *Tantrāloka*. The final subject treated is various kinds of
ritual (*kriyā*), daily (*nitya*) and occasional (*naimittika*) rites, explained
in *āhnika* 20 of the *Tantrasāra* and *āhnika*-s 15-29 in the *Tantrāloka*.
The chapter ends with some concluding verses that complete the entire work.
